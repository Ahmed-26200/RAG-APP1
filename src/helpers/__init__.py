Helper functions for the application:
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In software projects, a helpers package (or directory) typically contains utility functions or modules that perform specific, 
reusable tasks. These helper functions are often shared across various parts of the application to keep the codebase clean, organized, 
and maintainable. Here's how a helpers package is commonly used:

1) Reusability:
- The helpers package contains functions that are used across multiple parts of the application.
- It helps in reducing code duplication and making the codebase more modular and maintainable.
- Example: Functions for formatting dates, validating inputs, or converting data formats.

2) Separation of Concerns:
- The helpers package is often used to separate concerns within the application.
- It helps in keeping the application's core logic focused and easy to understand.
- the code in controllers, models, or routes remains focused on its primary responsibilities.

# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Examples of Helper Functions:
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- String Manipulation: Functions to modify or validate strings (e.g., snake_case_to_camel_case).
- API Helpers: Functions to handle API requests or responses, like generating headers or parsing data.
- Data Processing: Utility functions to transform or clean data (e.g., normalize values or handle special cases).
- Logging: Custom logging functions for better debugging.

When to Use Helpers
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
For tasks that are:
- General-purpose and unrelated to a specific module.
- Frequently repeated across the codebase.
